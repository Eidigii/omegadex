Tribe Quantum Storage is your tribe's very own infinite storage system. You can store all of your resources and items
and they'll be instantly accessible to everyone in the tribe.

Tribe storage is part of the map save and is very reliable and far less risky than other types of storage.

Tribe storage does not transfer across maps and is tied to the map that items are saved in.
