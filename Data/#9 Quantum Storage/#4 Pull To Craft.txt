Quantum Crafting will let you use the inventory button to craft items using materials directly from your Quantum
Storage.

Select an engram or blueprint in your personal or a remote inventory to be crafted, and use the text box to the left of
the quantum buttons to enter in how many you would like to craft. If no number is entered, it will default to 1.

The priority for material pulls is Tribe Storage, then Personal Storage, then your personal inventory.
