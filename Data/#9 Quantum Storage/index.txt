Welcome to the Quantum Storage Information section!

The Quantum Storage System is designed to be ASA's best item and inventory management system by giving players
nearly infinite storage that is accessible and usable from anywhere.

There are no structures involved, as all items are placed in a type of cloud storage. You can store the items no matter
where you are on the map, and can access them from anywhere as well.

you'll see in your inventory.
