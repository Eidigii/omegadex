Personal Quantum Storage is your character's very own quantum storage. This is only accessible by your player, and
will travel across maps with you.

Please note that this storage system isn't quite as reliable as the Tribe storage, although there is an automated backup
system that will restore your data to you if it is lost. If you travel maps and find that you've lost your storage, travel
back to the previous map to have it all restored. Quests, Rank, and Personal Storage are all saved in the same system,
so its impossible to lose one without the other.

When it comes to pulling from your personal storage for more automated options like repairing, crafting, or unlocking
chests, Personal Storage is 2nd in priority behind tribe storage.
