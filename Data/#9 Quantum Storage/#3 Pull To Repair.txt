Quantum Repairing will let you use the inventory button to repair items directly from your Quantum Storage.

If you don't select any items, the repair button will attempt to repair all items in your personal inventory. Otherwise, you
can select an item in your inventory, or a remote inventory to be repaired if you're just looking to fix a single item.

The priority for material pulls is Tribe Storage, then Personal Storage, then your personal inventory.
