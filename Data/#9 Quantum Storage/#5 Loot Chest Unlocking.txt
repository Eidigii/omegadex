The Quantum Storage system can unlock loot chests for you automatically using stored essence.

If you do not have enough essence in your personal inventory, you'll be given the option to attempt to use your
Quantum Storage.

The priority for material pulls is Tribe Storage, then Personal Storage, then your personal inventory.
