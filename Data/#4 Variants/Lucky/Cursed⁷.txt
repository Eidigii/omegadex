<span style="color:yellow;">Cursed</span>: The 7th Variant of Lucky. A bit of a contradiction, Cursed isn't exactly Lucky.
Cursed creatures apply random debuffs to enemies both when attacking, and when being
attacked, and have a combination of both dodge chance and damage reduction. When
killed, they drop a number of pre-cursed items using the curses from the Cursed Idol.
