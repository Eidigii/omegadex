<span style="color:gray;">Shield</span>: 

Shield is a form of tanking, applying a buff to nearby allies that negates damage they take
for a certain amount of hits.

Pressing Prone (X) will create an expanding Tek Shield, pushing away enemies and
protecting allies. Nothing can pass through the shield, not even projectiles.
