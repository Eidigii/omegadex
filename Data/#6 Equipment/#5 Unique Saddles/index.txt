Web Omegadex Unique Saddles updated on 08/24/2025

Unique saddles were designed to make dinos much more viable, especially weaker
dinos, but require either luck or skill to unlock.
Please note: They will only provide bonuses to the dino listed on the saddle, and no
other version of that dino.

Unique saddles are obtained by:
1. Killing the dino that the saddle belongs to. This does not include vanilla dinos.
2. Killing a saddle-buffed wild dinos. These are indicated by a golden ring around the
dino, and drop a token for a saddle when killed.
3. Killing minibosses that offer saddle tokens as rewards.
