-Delta: 25% -> 22.39%
-Gamma: 12.5% -> 14.93%

Variant Changes: 
-Loot: No longer provides random vanilla consumables (berries, meat, etc) or resources (wood, hide, stone, etc).
-Ghost: now has 3x ability damage in addition to its melee damage changes at night time. While ghost doesn't have an ability by default, this makes it pair well with unique/cursed saddle added variants. 
-Teleporter: To/From area explosion increase do 2x ability damage. Now deals 1x ability damage to everything it passes through.  The cooldown has been increased from 3 to 5 seconds. Added extra anti-mesh detection features. 
-Taming:
---Massively boosted the food drain and torpor gain they provide per tier, from a (1+Tier)*5 to (Tier+3)^2. 
---Previously this would be: 5x/10x/15x/20x/25x/30x/35x/40x/45x/50x/55x/60x. Now this would be: 9x/16x/25x/36x/49x/64x/81x/100x/121x/144x/169x/196x.
---Cost of taming potions has been increased as a result.
-Breeding:
---Breeding variants no longer go into stasis when tamed, allowing them to provide bonuses while out of render. 
---Now provide food to nearby babies (juvenile and above should still use a feeding trough).
---No longer provides Oviraptor buff for unfertilized egg production to improve server performance. Omega Egg Collector should be used for maximum egg generation.

Quantum Storage System: 
-Child/Replacement classes will now be used for Craft/Repair functions (any dino egg when it wants "dinosaur egg", etc).
-Pull to craft will now ignore water as an resource to prevent a failed pull because of a missing material.
-Fixed the tooltip descriptions not working in live game.
-Fixed a bug with pulling sometimes telling you that you don't have enough inventory space (stack mod/death recovery mod related so there may still be some cases of this bug, especially with cosmetics).
-Fixed a bug allowing items to go over the integer cap in tribe storage and become negative. 

Items: 
-Unstable Resistance Potions added.
-Cosmic Resistance Potions added.
-Resistance Potions are now 1 engram point to unlock instead of 6.
-Resistance Potion icon updated for Nature Resistance Potion.
-Resistance Potion buffs now use the item's icon.
-Taming potions are now 25 utility souls to craft. 
-Getaway orb description updated to show the different summons it can give in different modes.
-Fixed a bug causing variant paragons to be blank.
-The glider now does misc checks to make sure it doesn't continuously stack glider buffs.

Other:
-Ability Damage imbue for players added.
-Added a search option to the Omega Egg Collector's menus. 
-Lots of defunct files deleted.
-Phoenix are no longer tamed with Fire, and are KO tamed like everything else (for simplicity).
-Updated the descriptions on several buffs to give more detail about what they do.
-Stat multipliers for speed from Tiers removed. This will help with mounts becoming too fast and flying bosses at higher tiers being far too quick.

Loot Chest Changes: 
-Loot chests are now 50% larger in size to make them easier to spot in ASA's thick wilderness. 
-Hoarder chests are 20% larger than before.
-Loot chests no longer contain random vanilla consumables (berries, meat, etc) or resources (wood, hide, stone, etc).
-Hoarder chests now get a random unique saddle token.

Hybrids: 
-Hybrids no longer require the Gene Splicer from ASE to be created. Instead, the dinos can be mated together directly. 
-Species with valid hybrid offspring will mateboost each other (Spino and Stego can mate boost, etc). 
-Hybrids will have a 1% chance of spawning wild with either of their parent classes.
-Hybrids added:
---Spinego (Spino + Stegosaurus)
---Karkinte (Karkinos + Ammonite)
---Leechicurus (Leech + Doedicurus)
---Phoenix Drake (Rock Drake + Phoenix)
---Carbopleurodon (Liopleurodon + Carbonemys)
